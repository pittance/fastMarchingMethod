# fastMarchingMethod
Simple (not very good) Processing implementation of the fast marching method

This is a deliberately very simple (and slow) implementation of the fast marching method (FMM)
The code was written to allow image conversion into isolines that can be drawn on a pen plotter
The isolines are closer where the image is darker, further apart where the image is light
This is implemented using the FMM where the speed of propagation is defined by the brightness of an input image

Installation:
Download all files & the data folder and put them into your sketchbook folder

Processing:
Code was written in Processing 4.4.7 but should work in most recent versions of Processing
